Create a file-explorer using fzf-lua.  It will be a custom picker for fzf-lua.

- it should open on the current file directory by default
- starts on ../ (to be able to go back)
- should be possible to create new file (Ctrl + a)
- should have preview and icons (try to use some default fzf-lua picker to be able to have those if possible)
- Should be possible to rename a file (Ctrl + r) or multiple files (if selected with tab [dont forget to be able to select multile entries], opens a text buffer if the file names, you rename and save with :w)
- Should be possible to move a file (Ctrl + y) or multiple files (if selected with tab [dont forget to be able to select multile entries])
- Should be possible to cut a file (Ctrl + x) or multiple files (if selected with tab [dont forget to be able to select multile entries])
- Should be possible to delete a file (or multiple)
- enter will open a folder or a file
- if opening a folder, will clear the search input
- Ctrl-g should go to cwd
- After editing a file, should go back to the picker

The yank (ctrl + x and ctrl + y) saves the selecteds files in a list.  When pasting with Ctrl + p, will show a summary of all modifications and user can confirm or no.
